# Instructions for Adding to the Game Portfolio

This page explains some of the structure for adding to the game portfolio. 

## Top-Level File Structure

Each semester has a folder that follows the pattern of <year>-<semester as a number; 1=spring, 2=summer, 3=fall>. Our first semester doing this is fall 2020, which has the subfolder [/2020-3](/2020-3/index.md).

The semester folder contains an index.md file (e.g., this one: [/2020-3/index.md](/2020-3/index.md)), which contains all the [Team Entries](#Team Entries) (see below). 

The semester subfolder contains one folder for all the logos (e.g., [/2020-3/logos](/2020-3/logos)) and then one folder for each team (e.g., [/2020-3/ztoups](/2020-3/ztoups)). 

* The logos folder should only contain GIFs for each team's logo. 

* Each team's subfolder should contain any games / game versions that are featured on the site (P8 files), the matching HTML page and JS file that allows the game to be played (exported by PICO-8), and any game thumbnail GIFs to be used.

## Team Entries

The semester page has an entry for each team, as well as links to all of their work. This gets built up over time.
